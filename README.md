First go at game dev in Godot, using it as an outlet to get back into programming.
	
Based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpwc3ughKbZexDyPexHN2MXLliKAovkpl) by [jmbiv](https://www.youtube.com/@jmbiv_dev), though it is for Godot 3.2 so it is a little outdated.

Using [Kenny's free game assets](gameassets.com) as a starting place for assets.
	
Got some assistance from [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/tefk75/best_top_down_movement_in_godot_4/) on updating some of the syntax to Godot 4.0.
